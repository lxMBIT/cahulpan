Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use `figure` with the appropriate `class`. Each instance of `figure` is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.

## Figures (for images or video)

### Изделие первое

<figure>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/900x450.gif"><img src="http://placehold.it/900x450.gif"></a>
	<figcaption>Подпись к картинке.</figcaption>
</figure>


For those of you who may have content written by multiple authors on your site you can assign different authors to each post if desired.

Traditionally you would assign a global author for the entire site and those attributes would be used in all post bylines, social networking links in the footer, Twitter Cards, and Google Authorship. These `owner` variables defined in your `config.yml`

Start by creating an `authors.yml` file in the `_data` folder and add your authors using the following format.

### Изделие Второе
